I'm an experienced software developer, engineer, and aspiring data scientist.

Most of the last 10 years of my career has been spent applying various software frameworks to build out web applications. I love this, and think it's a great use case for technology.

Recently however I've found myself also very interested and curious in analytical and scientific applications of computing and because of this I am currently in the process of shifting my skills sets towards mathematics, statistics and data.
